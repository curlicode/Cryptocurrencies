# Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose

This repository contains the notebook file for the module challenge covering data pre-processing, unsupervised [machine] learning, and dimensionality reduction (PCA) with regards to analyzing Cryptocurrencies.  

The notebook includes the following deliverables:

* Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
* Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
* Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
* Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

## Objective

The business ask is a grouping of cryptocurrencies because of the numerous cryptocurrencies available.  The analysis is basic, only classifying clusters based on the volume of supply and coins mined—into three (3) categories

## Notes

The examples within the assignment show 2 classes but based on our elbow curve when analyzing, the optimal number of clusters for using K-means clustering was determined to be 4 (as well as 4 being the indicated number of clusters in other parts of the assignment prompt).
